Header Files:
At first I was bit confused why was he placing "public:"
before each thing he placed in the header file, looking at it now
I can see it makes it a lot easier to group similar and/or things
that belong together. For example the read and write functions
in the "Bus" class are grouped together and the cpu, which is a device
on the bus is within its own "public:" group in the same header file.
